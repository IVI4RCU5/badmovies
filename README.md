# Bad Movies

Learn the fundamentals of application structure and database integration by making a webapp which gives you horrible movies to look at based on certain search criteria. The user can then opt to save a movie to their favorites and also delete items they don't like anymore. 

Basic functionality: 

Searh for movies by genre

[ ] I should be given a list of official genres to choose from

[ ] I expect the movies to be sorted by horrible ratings first

[ ] If I click a movie on the search results, it will save to my favorites

[ ] If I'm viewing my favorites and click an item, it will remove the item (page should auto update)
